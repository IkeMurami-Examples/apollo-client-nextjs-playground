# Apollo Client NextJS

Use `apollo-client-nextjs` (v0.6.0, latest):
- Github: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs.
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support

This test project is based on [apollo-client-nextjs/examples/hack-the-supergraph-ssr](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/tree/main/examples/hack-the-supergraph-ssr) (I just removed chakra-ui from dependencies).  

## Getting started

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

and go to http://localhost:3000/.

There are two routes â€” `/` and `/product/product:1`.
